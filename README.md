# nsfw-detective

Please develop a private, local system for detecting NSFW content in users' Google Photos libraries, ensuring privacy and efficiency through a combination of technologies in a web application. A user-friendly tool designed to perform NSFW detection on Google Photos locally, prioritizing user privacy and delivering efficient, accurate, and neatly organized classification results. The tool aims to handle large amounts of photos seamlessly and provide a smooth user experience. Donâ€²t attempt to modify Googleâ€²s backend, just simply implement a system to run a localized nsfw detection model alongside / injected into the site such as NSFWJS or similiar.
